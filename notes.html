Poor Student Webscrape
Create an in-browser webscrapper, using the console, to collect the following information from centre's website

1. What are the majors, minors,professional programs and academic offerings at Centre College
2. What are the classes offered in Computer Science.

Provide a webpage that links to js files which depict your solution. (if you write the js files first you can copy them 
into the console all in one go).

If you are looking to do more, apply this techniques to collect similar information from 2 other colleges.

Recall that you will have to inject a script tag linking to d3 library, before you can scrape.
